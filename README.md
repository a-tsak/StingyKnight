# Stingy Knight

It is a university project for the subject "Programming II" I did with a classmate from university. A game where you play as a knight that can walk horizontally or vertically one step at a time, attack his opponent, or get hurt by an obstacle if he touches it.

Originally, every enemy has 5 health points when the game starts. When the knight hits his opponent, the opponent walks a step backwards from where they were, and their health goes down by 1 point.

Also, each round the knight can pick whether he wants to walk or attack an enemy. If the attack option is chosen, the knight can pick a certain weapon. Each weapon can harm the enemy by a different amount.

The game is based on a 2D matrix, where the "." sign represents the unoccupied places the knight can walk on, the "#" sign represents an obstacle, and the "@" sign represents an enemy.
